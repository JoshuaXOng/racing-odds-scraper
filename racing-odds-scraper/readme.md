Arhhhhh:

- Set a timeout for puppeteer `waitForSelector(...)` - handle
- Find out if `screenshot(...)` has an un-awaitable capture-length/delay - no, DOM does not load in fast enough
- Filter out green icon in bf schedule links (appears before event start)
- Add self closing functionality to pages (w/ a potential delay)
- Pages should self poll
- YYYYMMDDHHSS
- Bf seemingly does not update in race
